# Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) for Personal Information

This Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is entered into as of [date] by and between [your name] (hereinafter referred to as "Disclosing Party") and [agency name] (hereinafter referred to as "Receiving Party"). The Disclosing Party and Receiving Party may be referred to individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

## 1. Purpose and Scope

The Disclosing Party possesses certain personal information, including but not limited to confidential and proprietary information, trade secrets, and sensitive data (collectively referred to as "Confidential Information"). 

The purpose of this NDA is to protect the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information that is disclosed to the Receiving Party, ensuring it is not used for any current, ongoing, or past investigations or any other unauthorized purpose. 

This NDA applies to all Confidential Information that the Receiving Party obtains, accesses, or becomes aware of during the course of their official duties or through any other means. 

## 2. Definition of Confidential Information

"Confidential Information" for the purposes of this Agreement includes, but is not limited to:

- Personal information, such as name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other identifying data.
- Financial records, bank statements, tax returns, and any other monetary information.
- Medical records, health history, and any sensitive data related to physical or mental health.
- Employment history, performance evaluations, and any other job-related documents.
- Any information marked or designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary," or with a similar label.
- Oral, written, or electronic data or information that, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to cause harm or injury to the Disclosing Party.

## 3. Non-Disclosure and Restrictions on Use

The Receiving Party agrees that it shall:

- Hold and maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence, using the same degree of care as it uses for its own confidential information of a similar nature, but no less than a reasonable degree of care.
- Not disclose, disseminate, publish, or reveal any Confidential Information to any person, entity, or third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.
- Not use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than the specific purpose for which it was disclosed, and only to the extent necessary for such purpose.
- Not use any Confidential Information for any current, ongoing, or past investigations, or for any purpose that may adversely affect the Disclosing Party's rights or interests.
- Ensure that only authorized individuals with a need to know have access to the Confidential Information and that they are made aware of and agree to abide by the terms of this NDA.

## 4. Exclusions

Confidential Information shall not include information that:

- Is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.
- Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or use of the Confidential Information.
- Is required to be disclosed by applicable law, regulation, or court order, provided that the Receiving Party first notifies the Disclosing Party and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.

## 5. Return or Destruction of Confidential Information

Upon the Disclosing Party's request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information, including all copies, extracts, or reproductions, in whatever form, and shall delete or remove access to such information from any computer or electronic storage device, except to the extent that the Receiving Party is required by law to retain such information. 

## 6. Term and Termination

This NDA shall remain in effect indefinitely, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by both Parties. The obligations of confidentiality and non-use shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

## 7. Remedies

The Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information could cause irreparable harm and significant injury to the Disclosing Party, which may be difficult to ascertain. The Receiving Party therefore agrees that, upon any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, without the requirement of posting a bond, as well as monetary damages and any other remedies available at law or in equity.

## 8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This NDA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [state/province] and the Parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of [state/province].

## 9. Miscellaneous

- This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or simultaneous representations, discussions, negotiations, and agreements, whether written or oral.
- Any amendment or modification to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.
- The failure of either Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that Party's right to enforce any other provision of this Agreement.
- If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be substituted with a valid and enforceable provision that most closely reflects the intent and economic effect of the original provision.
- This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
- All notices or other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, by email with confirmation of receipt, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
